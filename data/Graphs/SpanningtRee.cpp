/*
    in a graph we have set of vertices and edges.

    Spanning Tree is a subgraph of a graph having all vetices V but V-1 edges.
    
    The no of spanning tree can be generate from a graph is 
        if v = no of vertice and e is no of edges.
        then no of sapnning tree is |e|C|v-1| <= this also includes cycles 
        so we have to remove the configurations whic forms cycles.
